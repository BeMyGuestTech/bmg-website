        within a vibrant, community-driven network enabling seamless
        interactions between individuals who offer a diverse range of
        accommodations, products, and services (&ldquo;Providers&rdquo;) and

        they are present with the guest) which may be availed by the Requesters
        in need of such accommodations (&ldquo;Accommodation&rdquo;), products
        for temporary rental or sale transfer to the Requesters who seek to
        acquire these products (&ldquo;Products&rdquo;) and a range of services

        short-term rentals, vacation homes, and unique stays, along with various
        Products that cater to diverse needs and interests, ensuring that Users
        have access to a comprehensive selection of options. Additionally, the
        Services offered span multiple categories including without limitation,
        childcare (e.g., babysitting, fun activities excluding medical and
        health care services), pet care (e.g., dog walking and pet sitting),
        transportation (e.g., carpooling), travel assistance (e.g., travel
        buddies), domestic support (e.g., cooking and personal training),
        logistical solutions (e.g., shipping), and creative endeavors (e.g.,
        photography), etc. Requesters utilize the Platform to find and
        &nbsp;avail these offerings. They can explore the extensive catalog of
        available Accommodations, Products, and Services to find the solutions

        to set the amount of corresponding BMG Points payable for the same. This
        means that Providers can establish their own point values depending on
        factors such as the type, quality, or duration of the offering. The
        final number of BMG Points charged for any given Accommodation, Product,
        or Service is entirely at the discretion of the Provider, reflecting
        their individual assessment of the value they provide and BMG does not
        play any role in assessing the correctness of the value or

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >In case of any dispute with BMG, the User and BMG shall first resolve
        such a dispute by mutual discussion. This provision shall only apply to
        disputes between the Users you and BMG arising under these Terms or our
        Privacy Policy, and not to any dispute between Users inter-se or Users
        and third persons. You may send a written description of your dispute.
        If, for any reason, the dispute is not satisfactorily resolved within
        ninety (90) days after BMG receives a written description of it, the
        Parties agree to the arbitration provisions below. &nbsp;To the extent
        permitted by applicable law, by agreeing to these Terms and by using the
        Platform, Users agree that any dispute between the Users and BMG arising
        out of or relating to these Terms or our Privacy Policy that is not
        satisfactorily resolved within ninety (90) days, shall be resolved by
        arbitration (&quot;Arbitration&quot;), conducted by a retired superior
        court judge or an impartial person selected from a list provided by the
        American Arbitration Association, to hear the dispute in New Jersey,
        using the commercial arbitration rules of American Arbitration (the
        &quot;Applicable Rules&quot;). The Parties may seek any interim or
        preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New Jersey,
        necessary to protect the rights and property of BMG pending completion
        of the arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in English. The
        arbitrator shall have the power to grant any compensation that would be
        available in a court of law or in equity, and any award by the
        arbitrator shall be final and binding on each party. The arbitrator
        shall not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary
        damages, which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator shall apply the
        applicable law and the provisions of these Terms (or our Privacy Policy,
        if applicable) and any failure to do so shall be considered an abuse of
        arbiter&rsquo;s power and grounds for judicial review. The
        arbitrator&#39;s decision shall include a written explanation and shall
        remain confidential. If any provision of this arbitration agreement
        contained in this section is found to be unenforceable, such provision
        shall be deleted, and the remaining terms of arbitration shall be
        enforced (but in no event shall there be collective, representative, or
        private arbitration by the attorney general). For purposes of this
        section, these Terms and related transactions shall be subject to and
        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). In
        addition, this section does not preclude a party from seeking interim
        relief in favor of the Arbitration in a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction. This section shall survive any removal from the Platform.
        If it is determined that the above arbitration provisions do not apply
        to you or to a particular claim or controversy, either as a result of
        your decision or as a result of an arbitrator&#39;s decision or court
        order, you agree that any claim shall be resolved exclusively in a state
        or federal court located in New Jersey. The Parties agree to submit to
        the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in New Jersey for the
        purpose of resolving any such claim or controversy. The parties are
        bound by the results of the Arbitration and the result of the
        Arbitration is final. You agree to service of process by email to the
        email address you have registered on the Platform. The parties shall
        each bear their own costs of the Arbitration. The prevailing party in
        any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
        entitled to recover costs, expert witness fees, attorneys&#39; fees, and
        arbitrator&#39;s fees.
